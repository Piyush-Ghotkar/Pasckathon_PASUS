## Problem Statment: Detection of Alzheimer's Disease

## Abstract Idea:
We have developed a mobile application that will help in the detection of Alzheimerâ€™s disease with the help of games along with speech analysis and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). After disease detection app will suggest nearby doctors for further diagnosis. The application will help individuals living with the disease to cope with symptoms and improve their quality of life. Family members & doctors will be able to monitor & track patients whenever required. App also provides daily activities (like brain games, exercise, etc.) to the users for keeping their brain active and thus helping in the prevention of disease. App can be useful for AD patients as well as normal people.
